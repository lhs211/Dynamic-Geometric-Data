abstract = {After adequately demonstrating the ability to solve different two-objective optimization problems, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) must demonstrate their efficacy in handling problems having more than two objectives. In this study, we have suggested three different approaches for systematically designing test problems for this purpose. The simplicity of construction, scalability to any number of decision variables and objectives, knowledge of the shape and the location of the resulting Pareto-optimal front, and introduction of controlled difficulties in both converging to the true Pareto-optimal front and maintaining a widely distributed set of solutions are the main features of the suggested test problems. Because of the above features, they should be found useful in various research activities on MOEAs, such as testing the performance of a new MOEA, comparing different MOEAs, and better understanding of the working principles of MOEAs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we provide a systematic comparison of various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization using six carefully chosen test functions. Each test function involves a particular feature that is known to cause difficulty in the evolutionary optimization process, mainly in converging to the Pareto-optimal front (e.g., multimodality and deception). By investigating these different problem features separately, it is possible to predict the kind of problems to which a certain technique is or is not well suited. However, in contrast to what was suspected beforehand, the experimental results indicate a hierarchy of the algorithms under consideration. Furthermore, the emerging effects are evidence that the suggested test functions provide sufficient complexity to compare multiobjective optimizers. Finally, elitism is shown to be an important factor for improving evolutionary multiobjective search.},

This paper presents a data structure for storing the whole population and their dominating information in MOEAs. This structure, called a Dominance Tree (DT), is a binary tree that can effectively and efficiently store three-valued relations (namely dominating, dominated or non-dominated) among vector values. This paper further demonstrates DT’s potential applications in evolutionary multi-objective optimization with two cases. The first case utilizes the DT to improve NSGA-II as a fitness assignment strategy. The second case demonstrates a DT-based MOEA (called a DTEA), which is designed by leveraging the favorable properties of the DT. The simulation results show that the DT-improved NSGA-II is significantly faster than NSGA-II. Meanwhile, DTEA is much faster than SPEA2, NSGA-II and an improved version of NSGA-II. On the other hand, in regard to converging to the Pareto optimal front and maintaining the diversity of solutions, DT-improved NSGA-II and DTEA are found to be competitive with NSGA-II and SPEA2."

abstract = {Dynamic multi-objective optimization problem (DMOP) often involves incommensurable, competing and varying objectives with time (environment), and the number of their Pareto optimal solutions is usually infinite, thus how to find a sufficient number of uniformly distributed and representative Pareto optimal solutions at any environment for the decision maker is very important. In this paper, we divide the time period of DMOP into several equal subperiods. In each subperiod, the DMOP is approximated by a static multi-objective optimization problem (SMOP). Furthermore, the static rank variance and the static density variance of the population are defined, by using the static rank variance and the static density variance of the population as two objectives, each SMOP is further transformed into a bi-objective optimization problem. As a result, the original DMOP is approximately transformed into several static multiobjective optimization problems. Thereafter, an environment changing feedback operator which can automatically check out the environment variation is proposed and an improved non-uniform mutation operator with quantization is designed. Based on these, a new dynamic multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm (denoted by DMEA) is proposed. The comparative study shows that DMEA is more effective and can find better solution set in environment-varying than the compared algorithms can in terms of convergence, diversity, and the distribution of the obtained Pareto optimal solutions.},

The available techniques produce very good results, but they have mainly been studied for problems of “low dimension”, i.e. with less than 10 optimization objectives. In this paper we study MOO for high dimensional spaces.We first review existing techniques and discuss them in our context. The pros and cons are pointed out. A new relation called ?-Preferred is presented that ex- tends existing approaches and clearly outperforms these for high dimen- sions. Experimental results are presented for a very complex industrial scheduling problem, i.e. a utilization planning problem for a hospital. This problem is also well known as nurse rostering, and in our application has more than 20 optimization targets. It is solved using an evolutionary approach. The new algorithms based on relation ?-Preferred do not only yield better results regarding quality, but also enhances the robustness significantl},

The estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), which models the global distribution of the population for searching tasks, is one of the evolutionary computation techniques that deals with noisy information. This paper studies the potential of EDAs; particularly an EDA based on restricted Boltzmann machines that handles multi-objective optimization problems in a noisy environment. Noise is introduced to the objective functions in the form of a Gaussian distribution. In order to reduce the detrimental effect of noise, a likelihood correction feature is proposed to tune the marginal probability distribution of each decision variable. The EDA is subsequently hybridized with a particle swarm optimization algorithm in a discrete domain to improve its search ability. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is examined via eight benchmark instances with different characteristics and shapes of the Pareto optimal front. The scalability, hybridization, and computational time are rigorously studied. Comparative studies show that the proposed approach outperforms other state of the art algorithms.},

abstract = {Coal remains an important energy source. Nonetheless, pollutant emissions – in particular Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) – as a result of the combustion process in a boiler, are subject to strict legislation due to their damaging effects on the environment. Optimising combustion parameters to achieve a lower NOx emission often results in combustion inefficiency measured with the proportion of unburned coal content (UBC). Consequently there is a range of solutions that trade-off efficiency for emissions. Generally, an analytical model for NOx emission or UBC is unavailable, and therefore data-driven models are used to optimise this multi-objective problem. We introduce the use of Gaussian process models to capture the uncertainties in NOx and UBC predictions arising from measurement error and data scarcity. A novel evolutionary multi-objective search algorithm is used to discover the probabilistic trade-off front between NOx and UBC, and we describe a new procedure for selecting parameters yielding the desired performance. We discuss the variation of operating parameters along the trade-off front. We give a novel algorithm for discovering the optimal trade-off for all load demands simultaneously. The methods are demonstrated on data collected from a boiler in Jianbi power plant, China, and we show that a wide range of solutions trading-off NOx and efficiency may be efficiently located.},

abstract = {In optimization studies including multi-objective optimization, the main focus is usually placed in finding the global optimum or global Pareto-optimal frontier, representing the best possible objective values. However, in practice, users may not always be interested in finding the global best solutions, particularly if these solutions are quite sensitive to the variable perturbations which cannot be avoided in practice. In such cases, practitioners are interested in finding the so-called robust solutions which are less sensitive to small changes in variables. Although robust optimization has been dealt in detail in single-objective optimization studies, in this paper, we present two different robust multi-objective optimization procedures, where the emphasis is to find the robust optimal frontier, instead of the global Pareto-optimal front. The first procedure is a straightforward extension of a technique used for single-objective robust optimization and the second procedure is a more practical approach enabling a user to control the extent of robustness desired in a problem. To demonstrate the subtle differences between global and robust multi-objective optimization and the differences between the two robust optimization procedures, we define four test problems and show simulation results using NSGA-II. The results are useful and should encourage further studies considering robustness in multi-objective optimization. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

@article{Goh2010,
abstract = {Multi-objective (MO) optimization is a challenging research topic because it involves the simultaneous optimization of several complex and conflicting objectives that requires researchers to address many issues which are unique to MO problems. However multi-objectivity is only one aspect of real-world applications and there is a growing interest in the optimization of solutions that are insensitive to parametric variations as well. In order to evaluate the capability of MO evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to find robust solutions, it is important to employ suitable test functions. In this paper, empirical studies are conducted to examine the suitability of existing robust test functions. Results suggest that these test functions have a bias towards the region where the robust solutions lie, rendering it difficult to assess the true capability of MOEAs. Motivated by such a finding, we present a framework for the construction of robust continuous MO test functions characterized by different noise-induced features. These noise-induced features can pose different difficulties to the optimization algorithms. A fitness-inheritance scheme is also presented and incorporated into two well-known MOEAs. Empirical analysis of the proposed robust MO test functions reveals that some noise-induced features present greater challenges to robust MOEAs as compared to existing robust test functions. In addition, the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demand (VRPSD) is presented as a practical example of robust combinatorial MO optimization problems. The work presented in this paper should encourage further studies and the development of more effective algorithms for robust MO optimization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Allmendinger2015,
abstract = {Building on recent work by the authors, we consider the problem of performing multiobjective optimization when the objective functions of a problem have differing evaluation times (or latencies). This has general relevance to applications since objective functions do vary greatly in their latency, and there is no reason to expect equal latencies for the objectives in a single problem. To deal with this issue, we provide a general problem definition and suitable notation for describing algorithm schemes that can use different evaluation budgets for each objective. We propose three schemes for the bi-objective version of the problem, including methods that interleave the evaluations of different objectives. All of these can be instantiated with existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In an empirical study we use an indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) as the MOEA platform to study performance on several benchmark test functions. Our findings generally show that the default approach of going at the rate of the slow objective is not competitive with our more advanced ones (interleaving evaluations) for most scenarios.},

@inproceedings{Helbig2016,
abstract = {Many real-world problems have more than one objective and are dynamic in nature, where either an objective function or constraint can vary over time. These problems are referred to as dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems (DMOOPs). A key challenge for dynamic multi-objective optimisation (DMOO) research is efficiently evaluating and analysing the performance of DMOO algorithms (DMOAs). This includes benchmarks, performance measures and the approach used to analyse the obtained results. Most research in recent years focussed on either dynamic single-objective or static multi-objective optimisation. In the field of DMOO, research focussed on unconstrained DMOOPs. A few papers have recently proposed constrained DMOOPs. Therefore, a key sub-challenge in DMOO is to have a standard benchmark suite that contains both unconstrained and constrained DMOOPs with various characteristics. In addition, the constraints used in the benchmarks should be guided by constraints that occur in real-world problems. Most approaches used to analyse the performance of DMOAs do not take into account how well a DMOA tracks the changing optimal solutions over time, i.e. how well it performs in each of the various environments. Furthermore, there are still certain DMOOPs that the proposed algorithms struggle to solve. Therefore, more research is required with regards to the development of algorithms that can solve DMOOPs efficiently. Another important aspect of DMOO is the decision making process that can either occur offline or interactively. This paper discusses these key challenges and progress that has been made to address these challenges. Furthermore, actions to deal with the outstanding issues are also proposed.},

abstract="As the name suggests, multi-objective optimisation involves optimising a number of objectives simultaneously. The problem becomes challenging when the objectives are of conflicting characteristics to each other, that is, the optimal solution of an objective function is different from that of the other. In the course of solving such problems, with or without the presence of constraints, these problems give rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions, popularly known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Because of the multiplicity in solutions, these problems were proposed to be solved suitably using evolutionary algorithms using a population approach in its search procedure. Starting with parameterised procedures in early 90s, the so-called evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO) algorithms is now an established field of research and application with many dedicated texts and edited books, commercial softwares and numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual conference series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and workshops held at all major evolutionary computing conferences, and full-time researchers from universities and industries from all around the globe. In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction to its operating principles and outline the current research and application studies of evolutionary multi-objective optmisation (EMO).",

By robust we mean that the quality of the solution does not falter completely when a slight change of the environment occurs, or that certain deviations from the solution should be tolerated without a total loss of quality. In this paper, a number of modifications to the standard evolutionary algorithm (EA) are suggested that are supposed to lead the EA to produce more robust solutions. Some preliminary experiments are reported where the proposed approaches are compared to a standard model. As it turns out, the EA's ability to create robust solutions can be greatly enhanced even without additional function evaluations.},
